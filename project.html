    <h2>Community</h2>
        <p>Through connecting & supporting each other, the Cardano Community
            grows stronger. This NFT series is not a silly 10k cartoon animal thats 
            been done 100 times over, sometimes on multiple blockchains. It's not a 
            random drop from some rarity table that the CNFT flippers crave - its all about you 
            and your connection to the community. Whether its through sharing protocol 
            updates, development resources, pool statuses, general knowledge, or even 
            just hilarious GIFs with each other, we're forming a fantastic web of 
            decentralized information within a dynamic and growing group of individuals. 
            We all have our own thoughts and opinions and this series aims to be a 
            beneficial representation of that.
        </p>

    <h2>Grassroots Funding</h2>   
            <p>Catalyst. Originally going to be Cardano Forest, but was finished before I 
            could finish learning to build this site. Link to current Fund/homepage
            </p>
    <br>
    <h2>Stability</h2>
            <p>This is not a get rich quick scheme - the goal is to bolster the community 
            and have fun doing so. There are many stake pool operators that run Cardano, 
            and they need our support to run the network. The idea is that this series
            builds up enough of an 'anchor' for pools to stay operational and mint blocks. 
            In doing so, hopefully more delegation is attracted and the network becomes
            stronger and better for it. 
            </p>

    <h2>Your Voice & Your Choice</h2>
        <p>I find it really annoying when you mint an NFT and don't get one you like - 
            thats the case with most of projects out there. People cope with it by 
            creating subgroups within the collectors, like the gold-skins or the smokers.
            Rather than forcing yourself to be happy with the result, with Community Coin
            you get to design yours! You can pick the 'traits' or whatever you want to call them -
            Background color or pattern, outline, and other extras are all up to you.
        </p>
        <p>Wen Roadmap? Other Ideas?</p>
        <p>Holders can vote on pools to delegate to?
           SPOs register and a lottery is done every 4 epochs?
           Use ADAHandle to automate random pledge increases to registered pools?
