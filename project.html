    <h2>Community</h2>
        <p>Through connecting & supporting each other, the Cardano Community
            grows stronger. This NFT series is not a silly 10k cartoon animal thats 
            been done 100 times over, sometimes on multiple blockchains. It's not a 
            random drop from some rarity table that the CNFT flippers crave - its all about you 
            and your connection to the community. Whether its through sharing protocol 
            updates, development resources, pool statuses, general knowledge, or even 
            just hilarious GIFs with each other, we're forming a fantastic web of 
            decentralized information within a dynamic and growing group of individuals. 
            We all have our own thoughts and opinions and this series aims to be a 
            beneficial representation of that.

    <h2>Grassroots Funding</h2>
        <h3>Catalyst</h3>    
        <p>Catalyst. Originally going to be Cardano Forest, but was finished before I 
            could finish learning to build this site. Link to current Fund/homepage
        </p>
        <h3>Armada Alliance</h3>
        <p>This is not a get rich quick scheme - the goal is to bolster the community 
            and have fun doing so. There are many stake pool operators that run Cardano, 
            and they need our support to run the network. The idea is that this series
            builds up enough of an anchor for pools to stay operational and to 
        </p>
        <h3>cost Breakdown</h3>
        <p>breakdown -> 50% to rotating stake in Armada Alliance pools, 25% to Catalyst treasury, 25% to mint service/IPFS pinning </p>
    <h2>A Voice</h2>
        <p>Wen Roadmap? </p>
        <p>Holders can vote on pools to delegate to?
           SPOs register and a lottery is done every 4 epochs?
           Use ADAHandle to automate random pledge increases to registered pools?
