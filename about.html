    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>First, thanks for checking out my page! I think it's so cool that this
            is out on the worldwide web and I not only built it, but 
            have the power to change it! crazy! 
            I've always wanted to learn how to do this, but never got around to it.
            Enter blockchain. I've been inspired by the technology and want to learn
            more, eventually being able to code in Haskell - it'll be a long journey
            but an exciting one. I think blockchain will make coding significantly
            mainstream, eventually being taught in schools at young ages like languages
            are today. Gotta keep up with kids these days! haha! 
        </p>
        <p>I work in healthcare IT currently, so nto totally foreign to coding but 
            it wasn't somethign I did everyday. I have enrolled in a course to learn 
            HTML, CSS, and Javascript and this webpage is the result of that course. 
            My hope is that one day I can work as a Cardano devloper, but thats far 
            in the future.
        </p>
        <p>I came up with the idea for this NFT project prior to enrolling in the 
            course and had no coding knowledge. I was checking out many of the cNFT 
            projects that were emerging on the Cardano blockchain and some really caught
            my attention - the were dynamic, not just an animation runnig on a loop 
            but living on-chain. Then I stumbled upon something totally outside of the 
            crypto-twittersphere. I saw this cool graphic that displayed
            the profile avatars of other user's around your avatar in the center, and
            it was customizable! Then the idea just popped into my head. Wouldn't it 
            be cool to have the avatars be the pips on the Cardano logo on a coin that
            could be a dynamic NFT that lived entirely on-chain. It would be a great 
            community connector!    
        </p>
