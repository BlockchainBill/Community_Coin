            <p>Community Coin is a Cardano-based project that aims to create an NFT series that dynamically displays your 
                community interactions on Twitter! #CardanoCommunity #ADAChain
                <div>This generator uses data that is <strong>publicly available, 
                you don't need to log in or provide your password </strong>.
                It determines who you interact with the most and it's all 
                based off of your most recent tweets and likes.
                Note that this is based off of <strong>YOUR</strong> interactions, not when you get liked, RT'ed, QT'ed, or @'ed.
                Hopefully in the future I can develop a version of this to work that way, 
                but it would likely require more data from you.
                Additionally, private accounts will not display - that's kinda how privacy works, lol.
                Then, it counts the number of interactions you've had with each account and then
                assigns them a score for the coin generator based off the table below. 
                The accounts are sorted into the coin with higher scores closer to the inner circle </div></p>
