        <p>Tired of the hacky copypasta 10k pfp cartoon animal NFTs? I am too and thats when I thought of this CNFT idea - the "Community Coin".
           I'm (obviously) not an experienced full-stack developer (as a friend recently said: "1993 called, they want their CSS back").
           This is my attempt to BUIDL something worthwhile in the Cardano Community.
           If anything comes of this, I have a fun thing I enjoy making and I have learned a lot in the process.</p>

        <h2>What is it?</h2>
        <p>The "Community Coin" is an NFT that aims to embody the spirit of the Cardano Community. 
          Its founded on four main pillars - Community, Grassroots Funding, Stability, and Fun. 
        </p>

        <h2>How does it work?</h2>
        <p>This generator uses data that is <strong>publicly available, you don't need to log in or provide your password </strong>.
           It determines who you interact with the most and it's all based off of your most recent tweets and likes.
           Note that this is based off of <strong>YOUR</strong> interactions, not when you get liked, RT'ed, QT'ed, or @'ed.
           Hopefully in the future I can develop a version of this to work that way, but it would likely require more data from you.
           Additionally, private accounts will not display - that's kinda how privacy works, lol.
           Then, it counts the number of interactions you've had with each account and then assigns them a score for the coin generator based off the table below.
           The accounts are sorted into the coin with higher scores closer to the inner circle</p>

        <h3>Scoring</h3>
        <table className='table table-sm'>
            <thead>
              <tr><th scope='col'> <strong> Interaction </strong> </th><th scope='col'> <strong> Score </strong> </th></tr>
            </thead>
            <tbody>
              <tr><td> <strong> Heart </strong> <small> (Like) </small> </td><td>1</td></tr>
              <tr><td> <strong> RT </strong> <small> (Retweet) </small> </td><td>1</td></tr>
              <tr><td> <strong> QT </strong> <small> (Quote tweet) </small> </td><td>2</td></tr>
              <tr><td> <strong> @ </strong> <small> (Mention) </small> </td><td>3</td></tr>
            </tbody>
